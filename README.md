Leisure coin will not support fiat currencies, and more coins will be added in time. Leisure coin exchange will have a 3 tiered vetting process.

1.   Tier #1 Require coin heads to release personal information to our team. A interview process, and popularity       review of the coin. These are our rating factors (safest for investor trading with minimal research required)

2.   Tier #2 Requires coin head release of personal information to our team, white paper review, use case review.       (Newer 
coin’s or coins being revamped and or swapped requires more in depth user research to invest.)

3.   Tier #3 Coins require a White paper, and just a use case with a quick review (Invest with caution no vetting       process conducted Trade at your own risk and do your own research)

These tiers will be separated on our exchange so you can choose your risk factor you are willing to take.
